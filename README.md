A representation of myself and personal page for web design experiments
## Goal
The goal is to make a fun website for myself to have fun but also represent me professionally. It should be made as simple as possible and only add complexity when needed (when I want to).
As of time of writing this project is hosted on GitHub pages and serves a static web page, because that is all that is needed.
I use Fable because I really love F# and would like to write my JavScript with it. The JavaScript is used for interactive and fun elements on the webpage but CSS and HTML is preferred when possible.
To make using styling easier, TailwindCSS (or is it "Tailwind CSS"?) is used where possible.
